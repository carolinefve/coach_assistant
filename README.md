## 💡 Introduction

The project is a web-based app featuring **AI-powered digital coaches** designed to provide **personalised and conversational workout guidance**. The app creates a seamless experience where your digital coach talks with you, explains exercises, counts repetitions, adjusts difficulty, and keeps you motivated throughout your workout.

Silvera is perfect for anyone who wants professional coaching but may not have access to in-person trainers, whether you’re travelling, exercising from home, or simply prefer flexibility.

## 🧩 Framing the Problem

Many people struggle to maintain consistent and effective workouts without the support of a coach. In-person training can be expensive or unavailable due to time, location, or travel.

Online workout videos and generic apps often fail to provide **real interaction** or **personalised guidance**, making it harder to stay motivated and track progress.

Our team has personally faced these challenges, from being away from our usual gyms to not having access to proper coaching.  
That’s why we built **Silvera**: to make professional guidance accessible and supportive, no matter where you are.

## 💭 Idea Explanation

**Silvera** acts as a **digital fitness coach** that guides users through their workouts in real time.

When a user starts a session, the AI coach:

- 💬 Explains each exercise in a friendly, clear way
- 🔢 Counts repetitions and tracks progress
- ⚙️ Adjusts difficulty based on user feedback
- 💪 Encourages and motivates throughout the session

The interaction feels conversational and supportive, like having a real coach by your side.  
Silvera helps users stay consistent, confident, and in control of their fitness journey.

### 🔄 Flow Overview

`User → Frontend → Backend → AI Engine → Database → User`

The user interacts with the web app interface, which communicates with the backend.  
The backend manages AI interactions and stores data to create a **personalised and evolving fitness experience**.

## ⚙️ Challenges

- 🗣️ **Creating natural conversation flow:**  
  Ensuring the AI could track exercises, repetitions, and difficulty while sounding natural required iterative testing and fine-tuning.

- ⏰ **Time management:**  
  With limited hackathon time, we prioritised the most impactful features first.

- 🎨 **Balancing design and functionality:**  
  We wanted a clean, modern interface that still allowed complex AI interactions, requiring close collaboration and quick problem-solving.

## 🏆 Accomplishments

✅ Built a functional AI-powered workout flow that feels natural and interactive  
✅ Designed a clean, user-friendly interface for smooth navigation  
✅ Developed a structured conversation system that adapts to user input  
✅ Learned how to integrate AI technology into an everyday wellness experience
